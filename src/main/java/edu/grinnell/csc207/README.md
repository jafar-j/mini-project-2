# mini-project-2
Jafar Jarrar

A program that applies basic mathematic operations on fractions and stores commands.

Resources used: 
- Lab writeup from class 4 regarding BigFractions for usage of methods, constructors, and Javadoc comments provided by Professor Rebelsky. I took methods directly from the lab and used them in my code, as well as took inspiration from the style of the methods and their implementation to write my own procedures.
